# Kazakh Ornaments Identifier

Welcome to my **Kazakh Ornaments Identifier** project! This repository explores the fascinating art of Kazakh ornaments and attempts to identify them using a mix of coding techniques and machine learning approaches. Although this project is still in progress, I’m excited to share what I’ve learned and hope it might spark your interest in cultural ornament detection.

## Overview

- **Goal**: Use machine learning or image processing techniques to recognize and classify different types of traditional Kazakh ornaments.
- **Why Kazakh Ornaments?**: Kazakh ornamentation holds deep cultural significance, and identifying these patterns can be both technically challenging and culturally enriching.
- **Status**: Ongoing - this is a learning project for me, so expect updates, refinements, and maybe the occasional experimental offshoot!

## Roadmap / To-Do
- Migrate from Google Colab to AWS SageMaker
 - Expand Dataset: Gather more diverse ornament samples for robust training.
 - Improve Model Performance: Test various architectures (ResNet, VGG, custom CNN, etc.).
 - Add Robust Evaluation: Incorporate confusion matrices, cross-validation, and other metrics.
 - User Interface: Build a simple web UI for ornament classification.
 - Cultural Insights: Provide context on the historical or cultural significance of identified ornaments.


## Contributing
I appreciate any help or suggestions! If you’d like to contribute:

- Fork this repo
- Create a new branch for your feature or fix
- Commit and push your changes
- Open a Pull Request describing what you’ve done
- All feedback, big or small is valuable. Whether you’re fixing a bug or suggesting a new approach, I’d love to hear from you.

Please respect the cultural origins of the ornaments and give credit where it’s due. Enjoy exploring this project, and I hope you find it both technically insightful and culturally enriching.
